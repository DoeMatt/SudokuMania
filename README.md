Hobby project to build a python 3.6 sudoku generator

0,5 file is the halfway piont, where the file generates a solution and removes x numbers, 
yet it does not inhibit multiple solutions. So you may find the sudokus unsolvable...

1,0 is the definitive version with filter against multiple solutions, and is under going testing... with pen and paper...
